Final Project Group 26 Team name: Lucid

## Project Overview
This project uses multiple datasets from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC) to determine **The Best Neighborhood In Pittsburgh**.

Each team member analyzed one submetric:
- **Road Bumps** – fewer speed humps (Mina)
- **Traffic Flow** – lower traffic counts (Zach)
- **Safest to Drive** – fewer traffic citations (Jermi)

Each person created an individual notebook.  
This repository also includes a **combined final notebook** with our group conclusion.
